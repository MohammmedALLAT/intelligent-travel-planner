# Intelligent Travel Planner

The **Intelligent Travel Planner** is a smart web application that helps users create optimized travel itineraries tailored to their preferences, time, and budget.  
It uses intelligent logic and APIs to suggest destinations, activities, and routes, making trip planning easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

## 🧭 Overview

Travel planning can be overwhelming — searching for attractions, organizing days, and managing time across multiple cities.  
This project aims to automate and simplify that process through an intelligent itinerary generator.

Users simply input their **destination**, **duration**, **budget**, and **interests**, and the system generates a well-structured travel plan that balances sightseeing, rest, and travel time.

## ✨ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Itinerary Creation** — Automatically generate multi-day plans based on user preferences.  
- **Smart Route Optimization** — Minimizes unnecessary travel between attractions.  
- **Personalized Recommendations** — Adjusts suggestions based on user interests (e.g., culture, nature, food).  
- **Interactive Interface** — Simple and intuitive design for exploring travel plans.  
- **Dynamic Content** — Can integrate APIs for maps, weather, and attractions (if configured).  
- **Extensible Architecture** — Designed for easy scaling and adding new travel data sources.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The app follows a modular structure:

/
├─ components/ # Reusable UI components (cards, modals, forms)
├─ context/ # State and context management
├─ services/ # Core logic (itinerary generation, API calls)
├─ constants.ts # Configuration and static constants
├─ types.ts # TypeScript definitions and interfaces
├─ App.tsx # Main application entry
├─ index.tsx # Renders the app to the DOM
├─ vite.config.ts # Build configuration
└─ metadata.json # App metadata

yaml
Copy code

Each part of the app is organized to separate **business logic**, **UI**, and **data handling**, ensuring cleaner code and easier updates.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   The user enters destination(s), trip length, budget, and interests.

2. **Planning Engine:**  
   The app processes this input and uses built-in logic (and optionally AI models) to generate a suggested itinerary.

3. **Itinerary Output:**  
   A day-by-day plan is presented, including activities, locations, and timing suggestions.

4. **Customization:**  
   Users can adjust the generated plan — rearranging activities, adding or removing places, or refining interests.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** – for robust, type-safe development  
- **React (with Vite)** – for fast, modern front-end development  
- **Context API** – for global state management  
- **APIs / AI models** – for itinerary generation (e.g., Gemini API)  
- **HTML5 & CSS3** – for responsive UI

## 🌍 Vision

The Intelligent Travel Planner aims to become a complete digital travel assistant —  
not just a trip planner, but a **companion** that adapts to user preferences and provides real-time insights, from weather updates to restaurant suggestions.

Future improvements may include:
- Integration with **Google Maps** or **OpenTripMap**  
- **Offline itinerary export (PDF/JSON)**  
- **User accounts & saved trips**  
- **Collaborative trip planning** for groups
